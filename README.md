# LOB_basic
This project is a simple implementation of a limit order book (LOB) in C++. It is designed as an educational tool to demonstrate the core functionality of matching buy and sell orders based on 
price-time priority. 

This is not a low-latency system. The primary focus is on correctness and clarity of the fundamental LOB mechanics, not on advanced features ligh high-frequency performance, network protocols 
or complex order types. 


# Features
